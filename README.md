# AllotmentChecker
Check out screenshot to quickly see how it work. Or
This is the main code of my desktop application to check for black out date and allotment run-out. It uses Selenium webriver to crawl our backend website and indentify any new blackout date or zero allotment records, then save to database and display a report. These new records will need to be marked as "Acknowledged" to disappear, otherwise they will continue to be displayed on the next report. That is the main idea. 
This code is intended to prove my coding capability only. Unzip them to a folder you will get the full code right there. You can view the code for example, but you will not be able to use it as it original purpose as you need a password to manual login to our backend.
